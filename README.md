  <h1> IMPORTANT NOTE!!!! </h1>
  We realized towards the end that our javascript is incompatible across various browsers. Some of our features work on Firefox but not Chrome and vice versa. For example, our task list functions properly in Firefox, while our leaderboard functions properly in Chrome. This is something to keep in mind when using Life<sup>2</sup>.

  <h3> A Brief Overview </h3>
  ---  
  Life<sup>2</sup> is an app that gamifies habits, to-do’s and goals to keep users on top of their game. 

  Upon registering, users will be given an avatar for which they can nurture, level, and pimp out by keeping in line with their habits and goals. 

  A user can create a list of habits to follow and a set of goals to achieve by creating their own or choosing from presets. 

  By completing these ‘quests’, the user receives bonuses and rewards that they can trade in for items.

  On the community side, users can check a global leaderboard for their placement. They can also share their custom quests so that other users can use them.

  <h3> How to use our site? </h3>
  
  1. Create an account. After you login, you can see the profile bar in the middle of the page. It displays your avatar and if you click on it, you can view your personal stats. On the right side, you will see your health bar. Your health depletes when you do not complete your goal or daily on time. Everytime you complete a task, your experience points will increase. 

  2. Click on the Leaderboard tab to view other users and their stats. Shift between the different tabs to sort the leaderboard differently. 

  3. Click on Tasks tab to manage your tasks (add, delete, edit, complete, etc). You can also set rewards of your choice or purchase from our custom store.

  4. Click on the Store tab to find our wide selection of equipments and other accessories to upgrade your avatar. Purchase them with the coins you've earned and upgrade the stats of your avatar.
