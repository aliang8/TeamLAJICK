  <h3> A Brief Overview </h3>
  ---  
  “Life<sup>2</sup>” is an app that gamifies habits, to-do’s and goals to keep users on top of their game. 

  Upon registering, users will be given an avatar for which they can nurture, level, and pimp out by keeping in line with their habits and goals. 

  A user can create a list of habits to follow and a set of goals to achieve by creating their own or choosing from presets. 

  By completing these ‘quests’, the user receives bonuses and rewards that they can trade in for items.

  On the community side, users can check a global leaderboard for their placement. They can also share their custom quests so that other users can use them.
